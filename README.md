# Web Dev Journey

This repo tracks my progress as I learn full-stack web development.

## 📁 Structure

- `js-fundamentals/` — JavaScript basics (functions, arrays, loops, etc.)
- More folders to come as I learn HTML, CSS, JS, frameworks, etc.

## 🚀 Goals

- Finish The Odin Project's JS track
- Build in public (update README + comment code as I go)
